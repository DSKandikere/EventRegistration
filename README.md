# EventRegistration
The Event Registration System is a simple Java web application built using JSP, Servlets, JDBC, and MySQL. It allows users to register for events by submitting their name, email, and event name through a web form. Submitted data is stored in a MySQL database, and users are redirected to a success page upon successful registration.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:
1. Java (JSP + Servlets)
2. JDBC for database interaction
3. MySQL for data storage
4. Apache Tomcat as the server
5. Eclipse IDE for development

ðŸ’¡ Key Features:
1. Simple and clean user interface
2. Backend validation and database insertion
3. Modular Java code (with DB connection class)
4. Easily extensible to include more features like login or listing registered users
